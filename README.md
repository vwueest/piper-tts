# Piper for text to speech

Install with
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

based on the [piper project](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper)

download models from [here](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/blob/master/VOICES.md) and rename the json file to `{model}.onnx.json`

I used libritts_r-medium model with speaker number 7
